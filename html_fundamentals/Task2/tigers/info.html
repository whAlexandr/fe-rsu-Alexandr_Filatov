<b>The tiger</b> <i>    is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of dark vertical 
stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The largest wild tiger ever reported had a total
 body length of 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and weighed 388.7 kg (857 lb). The species is classified in
 the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily
 preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals,
 often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the 
 fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant
 conflicts with humans.</i>

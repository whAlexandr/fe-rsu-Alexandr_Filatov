<b>Foxes</b> <i>    are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera
 of the family Canidae. Foxes are slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic dog, with a flattened skull, 
 upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).
Twelve species belong to the monophyletic group of Vulpes genus of "true foxes". Approximately 
another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part 
of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of bat-eared fox,
 gray fox, and island fox. Foxes are found on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and
 widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global 
 distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence
 in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds,
 long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to 
 various parts of the New World.</i>

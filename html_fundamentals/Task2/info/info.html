Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated
		animal species, but has come to include all plants,
		fungi, and other organisms that grow or live wild in 
		an area without being introduced by humans.
Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests,
 rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including
 the most developed urban sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. 
 While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are 
 untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife 
 is affected by human activities.
Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife 
in a number of ways including the legal, social, and moral sense. Some animals,
 however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as
 domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and gerbils. Some religions declare certain animals
 to be sacred, and in modern times concern for the natural environment has provoked 
 activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.

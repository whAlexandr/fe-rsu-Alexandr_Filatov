<p class="textaling">This is a short story about Hungry Wolf. 
Once, a wolf was very hungry. It looked for food here and there.
 But it couldn't get any. At last it found a loaf of bread and piece 
 of meat in the hole of a tree. 
The hungry wolf squeezed into the hole. It ate all the food.
 It was a woodcutter's lunch. He was on his way back to the 
 tree to have lunch. But he saw there was no food in the hole,
 instead, a wolf. 
On seeing the woodcutter, the wolf tried to get out of the hole.
 But it couldn't. Its tummy was swollen. 
The woodcutter caught the wolf and gave it nice beatings.
